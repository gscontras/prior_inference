\begin{abstract}
Grice's maxim of manner postulates that ambiguity should be avoided to maximize clarity.
Nonetheless, ambiguity is ubiquitous during conversations.
% It has been suggested that some ambiguity may be useful for efficiency reasons in cases when clarity is not affected.
Here, we investigated whether disambiguations of ambiguous utterances yield a socially-relevant benefit.
We asked whether responses to ambiguous utterances can reveal parts of the internal model of the interpreter. 
More concretely, we asked if speakers (i) can use responses as a source of information to infer unknown preferences of their conversation partner, and (ii) are able to strategically chose ambiguous utterances over unambiguous utterances for learning about their conversation partner's preferences. 
We ran two web-based experiments using a modified version of the original reference game framework \cite{frankgoodman2012} and modeled the recorded data by modifying the vanilla Rational Speech Act model.
The data and modeling results confirm both points. 
Participants were able to infer Bayesian posteriors of listeners' preferences when analyzing their choice of objects in situations of referential ambiguity.
Moreover, nearly 40\% of the speakers were able to strategically choose ambiguous over unambiguous utterances in an epistemic, goal-directed manner, maximizing expected information gain about the listeners' preferences.
Surprisingly, an equally-large number of participants seemed to minimize expected information gain by systematically choosing unambiguous utterances. 
Our results thus show that ambiguity resolution can reveal aspects of the knowledge, preferences, and beliefs of conversation partners, and that some of us are able to strategically use (ambiguous) utterances to gain knowledge about these aspects.
%We investigated and modeled how speakers learn about opinions, preferences, and beliefs of their conversation partners when monitoring their responses.

%\section*{Introduction}

\noindent Active inference---that is, the anticipatory, goal-directed, and epistemic invocation of behavior---is
closely linked to the predictive mind perspective \cite{Friston:2015,Hohwy:2013,Clark:2016}. 
The anticipatory nature of the human mind reveals itself in many domains.
With respect to planning and executing manual sensorimotor interactions, 
it has been shown that we anticipate future events and event boundaries, revealing anticipatory active inference processes \cite{belardinelli2016s, belardinelli2018mental,Friston:2015,Hayhoe:2003,lohmann2019hands}.
Also in the language domain, predictive active inference processes seem to continuously unfold \cite{Christiansen:2016}, compressing information into event-like units of thought \cite{Gaerdenfors:2014}.
For example, neurophysiological data has shown that listeners predict the semantic category of upcoming words \cite{federmeier2002picture}.
Moreover, the inference process takes the structural properties of sentences into account \cite{levy2008expectation}.
Dynamic language models show that complex, event-predictive structures guide ambiguity resolution during comprehension and likely also constrain ambiguity generation during language production \cite{Elman:2019}. 

When systematic abstractions become relevant, event-predictive processes seem to be at play, compressing sensorimotor experiences, including language, into event-predictive encodings \cite{Butz:2016,Butz:2017a}.
Various disciplines associated with cognitive science suggest that our minds develop event-compressed predictive encodings, which are recruited during decision making and action generation, including language production and comprehension, essentially determining thought itself in a highly active, epistemic, goal-directed manner  \cite{Baldwin:2019tsi,DuBrow:2019tsi,Elsner:2019tsi,Fallgatter:2019tsi,Knott:2019tsi,Papafragou:2019tsi,Zacks:2019tsi}.
Here, we reveal socially epistemic comprehension and utterance productions while observing and generating social event-predictive interactions.


In two main studies, we show how speakers update predictive models of the listener's preferences and beliefs when watching social event interactions, such as when offering a few objects to choose from and observing the object choice of the conversation partner. 
We thus show that humans can interpret behavior of other people as driven by their motives, intentions, or personal characteristics.
Conceptually, this idea goes back to the attribution theory \cite{jones1965acts, kelley1967attribution, kelley1970social}.
More recently, \citeA{shafto2012learning} developed a Bayesian model of learning that formalizes the process of inferring others' knowledge about the world based on their actions and goals. They argue that efficient learning is possible if we assume that agents' actions are driven either by physical (non-social) or communicative goals, but are crucially not random. The authors show that an observer can draw stronger inferences concerning an underlying hypothesis when the acting agent has a communicative goal.
The developed model predicts that learners use knowledge of agents' goals to evaluate how knowledgeable they are, and, as a consequence, how much a learner can trust their actions to be informative about a hypothesis.
 

While our model also pursues Bayesian inference---that is, psychological reasoning---we do not focus on the inference of the actor's knowledge---that is, on \emph{learning from others} \cite{shafto2012learning}.
Rather, we focus on \emph{learning about others}, that is, learning about listeners' preferences when observing their disambiguating behavioral responses.
We explore interpretive choices and the potential strategic, socially epistemic usage of ambiguous utterances in anticipation of actors' responses. 
To formalize our hypothesis, we adapt the Rational Speech Act model framework, reliably modeling the involved, probabilistic interpretation processes and socially epistemic action choice. 
Interestingly, the modeling results reveal good interpretive abilities but also strong individual differences when the task is to choose (ambiguous) utterances strategically for gaining social knowledge. 


%Then we present the results of two experiments that test whether subjects are able to infer the preferences of an agent that led her to a particular choice of objects and pick the utterances are most useful to create the possibility of learning about the preferences of the conversation partner. We compare the results of behavioral experiments to a proposed formal model that infers preferences of a participants based on their choices, and evaluates which utterance is optimial to create a situation of ambiguity resolution.  We conclude that participants were indeed able to use observable behavior of others to infer their prior beliefs, and hypothesizes why the ability to intentionally create epistemic situations can be found only in part of the population.

%In Section 3, we develop computational models that are able to infer the preferences of an agent that led her to a particular choice of objects, as well as a model that predicts which utterances are most useful to create the possibility of learning about the preferences of the conversation partner. 
%Sections 4 and 5 give the results of behavioral experiments and modeling performance. 
%Section 6 concludes that participants were indeed able to use observable behavior of others to infer their prior beliefs, and hypothesizes why the ability to intentionally create epistemic situations can be found only in part of the population.

We use ambiguity resolution as a paradigm in which learning about others is possible.
Intuitively, ambiguity should make understanding each other difficult.
If a speaker and a listener understand an ambiguous utterance differently, communication between them might fail.
On rare occasions, such communication failure can even be deadly: 
\citeA{pinker2015sense} alludes to the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War as an example of a military disaster that was caused by vague orders.
He also mentions how poor wording on a warning light was responsible for the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island. Finally, citing \citeA{cushing1994fatal}, Pinker describes how the deadliest plane crash in history resulted from pilots and air traffic controllers arriving at different interpretations of the phrase ``at takeoff''.

Given that ambiguity can hinder the efficient transfer of information between conversation partners, it is not surprising that linguists have treated the possibility for ambiguity as a bug in the communication system \cite{grice1975,chomsky2002minimalism}. The attitude towards ambiguity has been quite different in other disciplines, in part because the term itself can refer to multiple phenomena. For linguistic research, a word is ambiguous if it can have two separate meanings even in the absence of context, simply as a linguistic sign. In that sense, the word ``bat" is ambiguous between a winged mammal and a sporting implement. In organizational communication---communication that aids production---ambiguity aligns closely with underspecification: an utterance is ambiguous when it does not provide every detail about the intended meaning, leaving room for the listener to interpret it. In the case of referential ambiguity, an ambiguous utterance may apply to several possible referents in a scene. For example, a pronoun can be referentially ambiguous if there are multiple potential antecedents in the context. It is the latter type of ambiguity that we are concerned with in this paper.

%If we look back at the study of ambiguity, we notice that the strategy of ambiguity avoidance is much older than the pronouncements by modern linguists. Greek and Latin rhetoricians believed that a skillfully-written text allows for a perfectly accurate and lossless transmission of meaning to the listener or reader \cite{ossarichardson2019}; such a text avoids ambiguities.
%
%Still, despite the teachings of classical philologists, authors continued to  create ambiguous texts and readers were faced with the challenge of interpreting them. The Bible is one of the most significant of such texts. In the sixteenth century, the Catholic church responded to the Reformation by proposing that the Bible can contain multiple meanings---\citeA{ossarichardson2019} equates these meanings with multiple paths that lead readers to God. In a sense, this proposal contained one of the first acknowledgments of the virtue of ambiguity, though with an important caveat: only God could introduce ambiguity, humans should not. 
%
%The search for efficient transmission of meaning has rested on an important assumption: we communicate to transfer knowledge to our conversation partner. It is the efficiency of this transfer that many recent experiments were designed to evaluate. To be more precise, communication was considered efficient if an experimental participant could follow instructions precisely. Yet, ordering actions and following instruction are probably not  the most common types of communicative acts \cite{foppa1995mutual}, and information-seeking might not be the only communicative task in which we engage \cite{markova1995preface}
% \gcs{not sure what is meant by this last bit}. 

More recent research has begun to take notice of the efficiency ambiguity affords us: by relying on context to fill in missing information, we can reuse lightweight bits of language rather than fully specifying the intended message \cite{levinson2000,piantadosietal2012,wasow2015}. 
Viewed in this way, ambiguity serves as a feature---not a bug---of an efficient communication system.
This reasoning accords with years of psycholinguistic research documenting that speakers readily produce ambiguous utterances (see \citeNP{ferreira2008}, for an overview). 
Along related lines, \citeA{wasow2015} reviews a large body of evidence and concludes that ambiguity is rarely avoided, even in situations where its avoidance would be communicatively appropriate.
This observation stands at odds with the Gricean maxim to avoid ambiguity (\citeNP{grice1975}).
%However, even \citeauthor{grice1975} recognized a case of strategic ambiguity where it could be the intention of the speaker to communicate more than one possible interpretation afforded by an ambiguous utterance. In such cases, recognition of the ambiguity serves as the communicative purpose of the utterance. \citeA{wasow2015}, on the other hand, reviews several cases where ambiguous production serves no obvious communicative purpose.

%The field of communication sciences views ambiguity as an important communicative tool. %\footnote{We would like to thank an anonymous reviewer at XPrag Conference for highliting the relevance of this field of study.} 
%In organizational communication, ambiguity has traditionally stood in opposition to clarity. However, as \citeA{eisenberg1984ambiguity} notes, clarity is not necessarily a communicative goal in all conversations. 
%Speakers may prefer to remain ambiguous to leave room for the listener's perspective. This freedom is important in communication between managers and their employees, particularly when managers set goals with the intention of stimulating creativity \cite{mohr1983implications}.
%In addition, ambiguity allows the somewhat general expression of ideas that are true for a group of people. 
%For example, consider company slogans or vision statements, where the language must be vague enough to allow every member of the audience to relate to a company's avowed aims \cite{carmon2013}. 
%%\gcs{I think we should specify what we mean by ``ambiguity'' early on} Ambiguous descriptions also allow speakers to avoid conflict 
%Accordingly, \citeA{pascale1981art} show that interlocutors often employ utterances that allow for a range of interpretations and do not enforce a particular viewpoint.
%
%\citeA{eisenberg1984ambiguity} further specifies that ambiguity does not necessarily stand in opposition to clarity. In communication with close friends, for instance, interlocutors can use incomplete phrases or vague referential expressions and nevertheless resolve the ambiguity in accordance with the speaker's intention through the use of restricted codes---shared knowledge and beliefs. The participants may not even perceive the utterances as ambiguous in such situations. We believe that the experience of shared codes gives rise to the sense of within-group cohesion and social bonding between group members.
%As a result, members of the same group can be expected to sense a high level of mutual understanding when ambiguous and vague utterances are resolved in accordance with the group's prior beliefs, preferences, and knowledge.
%In this paper, we thus focus on the effects of resolving, or anticipating the resolution of, ambiguous utterances, modeling the involved probabilistic inference processes. 

%\subsection{Computational modeling}

In search of the communicative purpose of ambiguous language, the current work identifies an additional benefit: the \emph{extra} information we gain from observing how listeners resolve ambiguity.
We show that language users learn about each other's private knowledge when observing how ambiguity is resolved. 
When utterances leave room for interpretation, listeners must draw on their opinions, beliefs, and preferences to fill in the gaps;
by observing the concrete interpretation, speakers thus learn about the opinions, beliefs, and preferences of their conversation partner.
As a result, in a naturalistic conversation, where speakers take turns, ambiguous utterances open interpretation spaces and the resulting interpretation choices dynamically and mutually reveal individual opinions, beliefs, and preferences. 


By way of illustration, take the scenario in Figure \ref{FG-ref-game}.
Suppose a speaker produces the single-word utterance ``blue'' -- meaning choose a blue object -- offering a referential ambiguity, that is, a choice between a blue square and a blue circle to the listener. 
Suppose further that, upon hearing ``blue,'' the listener selects the blue circle.
In observing this choice, the speaker learns something about the private thoughts of the listener: what made her select the blue circle instead of the blue square? Perhaps the circle is more salient to the listener, or the listener has a preference for circles, or the listener may believe that the speaker has a preference for circles; there may even be mutual agreement that circles are to be preferred when possible. Importantly, by observing how the listener resolves the ambiguity in reference, the speaker can learn something about the private thoughts of the listener.

\end{figure}

However, accessing this added information requires the speaker to reason pragmatically about the pragmatic reasoning of the listener---a higher-order pragmatic reasoning, as it were.
In order to select a referent, the listener must interpret the utterance. We follow \citeA{frankgoodman2012} in treating this interpretation process as active pragmatic, probabilistic reasoning: the listener interprets an utterance by reasoning about the process that generated it, namely the speaker, who selects an utterance by reasoning about how a listener would interpret it. \citeauthor{frankgoodman2012} model this recursive social reasoning between speakers and listeners within the Rational Speech Act (RSA) modeling framework (cf. \citeNP{frankejaeger2016,goodmanfrank2016}).

RSA formalizes a state space $S$ in the form of a particular set of objects (cf.~the example in Figure~\ref{FG-ref-game}) and an utterance space $U$, which consists of the set of possible utterances; when conceived of as a set of single-word utterances, $U$ amounts to the set of all features present in $S$. 
At the base of the reasoning process, there is a hypothetical, na\"ive literal listener $L_0$, who hears an utterance $u\in U$ and attempts to infer the object $s \in S$ that $u$ is meant to reference. 
$L_0$ performs this inference by conditioning on the literal semantics of $u$, \sem{$u$}$(s)$, which returns $true$ (i.e., 1) for those objects that contain the uttered feature and $false$ (i.e., 0), otherwise.
As a result, object choice probabilities for the literal listener can be computed:  
$$P_{L_{0}}(s\mid u) \propto \sem{$u$}(s),$$
essentially returning a uniform distribution over those objects in $S$ that contain the uttered feature $u$.\footnote{Note that the context $S$ is typically not made explicit, but rather treated implicitly in the specification of the model.}


One layer up, the speaker $S_1$ observes the state $S$ and is assumed to have the intention to refer to a particular object $s \in S$.
$S_1$ chooses an utterance $u$ on the basis of its expected utility for signaling $s$ in the situation $S$, which is determined by the log-likelihood of this particular object choice $U_{S_1}(u;s)$\footnote{The original model in \citeA{frankgoodman2012} also includes a term for the utterance cost, $C(u)$. We ignore the term here since we assume uniform cost over all utterances.}:
$$U_{S_{1}}(u;s) = \textrm{log}(P_{L_{0}}(s \mid u)).$$ 
Depending on a ``greediness'' factor $\alpha$, the speaker chooses a particular utterance $u$ with a probability that is exponentially proportional to the utility estimate: 
$$P_{S_{1}} (u \mid s) \propto   \textrm{exp}(\alpha \cdot U_{S_{1}} (u;s)).$$

At the top layer of the vanilla RSA model, the \emph{pragmatic} listener $L_1$ infers posteriors over $s$ on the basis of some observed utterance $u$.
However, unlike $L_0$, $L_1$ updates beliefs about the world by reasoning about the process that \emph{generated} $u$, namely $S_1$.
In other words, $L_1$ reasons about the $s$ that would have been most likely to lead $S_1$ to utter $u$:
$$P_{L_{1}}(s \mid u) \propto P_{S_{1}}(u \mid s) \cdot P(s).$$

\citeA{frankgoodman2012} tested the predictions of their model against behavioral data from reference games, as in Figure~\ref{FG-ref-game}.
To model production behavior (that is, which utterance should be chosen to communicate a given object), the authors used the probability distributions from $S_1$.
To model interpretation behavior (i.e., which object the speaker is trying to communicate on the basis of their utterance), the authors generated predictions from $L_1$.
Finding extremely strong correlations between model predictions and behavioral data in both cases, \citeauthor{frankgoodman2012} have strong support for their model of pragmatic reasoning in reference games (see also \citeNP{qingfranke2015}, for a fuller exploration of the modeling choices).


The current paper builds on the foundational, vanilla RSA model of reference games by introducing uncertainty about the prior beliefs of the listener and modeling a speaker who reasons about these beliefs on the basis of the observed referent choice -- inferring belief posteriors -- and who reasons in anticipation of potential referent choices -- inferring potentially epistemic utterances. 
% Martin: this is not necessary here:
%We begin by walking through our modeling assumptions. 
%We then present our models in full detail, and test the behavioral predictions of our models against human data in a series of web-based experiments.
%We conclude with a discussion of the significance of our findings for understanding ambiguity in natural language, and relate the findings to current theories of predictive coding and active inference.


\section*{Results}

The main contributions of this paper are two-fold: first, we demonstrate that participants are indeed able to infer hidden beliefs of their conversation partners observing their choices; second, we show that some speakers can actively create situations of uncertainty anticipating the epistemic value when observing the consequent referent choice. 
We formalize the human communicative behavior in a probabilistic Bayesian model, which approximates the dynamically unfolding reasoning processes, including limits thereof. 
%\subsection*{Model}
%Our model is a modified version of the vanilla RSA model \cite{frankgoodman2012}. 
%\gcs{I'm not sure I follow the update to the variable naming (the prime vs.~not-prime distinction) in the prose and updated probability expressions. I'm used to the convention of capital letters for sets (so, $S$ and $U$ for the set of possible states/utterances), and \sem{$u$}($s$) maps $s$ to a boolean (true or false), not a set---at least this is the convention from semantics. Also, I worry that there might be a couple of inconsistencies in the use of prime vs.~not-prime variables, but I'm hesitant to change things without understanding how they're being used.}
%It formalizes a state space $S$ in the form of a particular set of objects (cf.~the example in Figure~\ref{FG-ref-game}) and an utterance space $U$, which consists of the set of possible utterances; when conceived of as a set of single-word utterances, $U$ amounts to the set of all features present in $S$. 
%Moreover, the model 
%considers probability distributions over those sets, $P(S)$ and $P(U)$, as well as 
%a particular object $s\in S$, which the speaker may refer to by means of one particular utterance $u \in U$.
%It 
%specifies priors or posteriors over referenced objects, object choices, utterance preferences, and utterance choices. 
%For notational convenience, we denote a particular object choice of the listener by $s \ in$ $S$.
%RSA then models a recursive social reasoning processes, incorporating several levels of probabilistic inference. 


%\subsection*{Rational Speech Act model (RSA)}

% The recursive social reasoning inherent to the RSA modeling framework gets cashed out as various layers of inference.

\subsection*{Pragmatic social inference RSA model}

Our model builds on the vanilla version of RSA presented above, modifying the listener's state prior $P(s)$ and enhancing the reasoning process towards a social component, yielding a \emph{pragmatic social inference RSA} model (PSIRSA). %In that sense, the model belongs to the family of models known as uncertain RSA \cite{goodmanfrank2016}. 
By changing $P(s)$ to a non-uniform distribution, we essentially model prior beliefs of which object the speaker is more likely to refer to, or---when viewed from a more self-centered perspective---which prior object feature preferences $f$ the listener may have. 
For example, the listener may like blue things, such that she may be more likely to choose the blue square instead of the green one when hearing the utterance ``square'' in the scenario shown in Figure~\ref{FG-ref-game}.
As a result, when a pragmatic speaker produces utterance $u$ and observes the listener's referent choice $s$, the speaker may infer posteriors over possible feature preferences, attempting to explain the observed object choice in this way.

We use $L_0$ and $S_1$ from the vanilla model, but we now parameterize $L_1$'s state prior such that it operates given a feature preference $f$:
$$P_{L_{1}}(s\mid u,f) \propto P_{S_{1}}(u \mid s) \cdot P(s \mid f).$$
We then model a pragmatic speaker $S_2$, who updates beliefs about $L_1$'s preferences, $P(f)$.
$S_2$ observes $L_1$'s choice of $s$ given the produced utterance $u$ and then reasons about the likely feature preference $f$ that $L_1$ used to make the observed choice:
$$P_{S_{2}}(f\mid u,s) \propto P_{L_{1}}(s \mid u,f) \cdot P(f).$$

We also model the reasoning process by which a speaker may select the best utterance to learn about the preferences of the listener, essentially striving to maximize expected information gain concerning the listener's feature preferences.
Starting with no knowledge of the listener's preferences, $S_2$ can be assumed to expect a uniform (i.e., flat) feature preference prior $P(f)$.
The more the speaker's posterior beliefs about the preferences, $P_{S_{2}}(f\mid u,s)$, deviate from the uniform prior, the more the speaker will have learned about the listener's preferences. 
We can thus model this reasoning in light of expected information gain, which can be equated with the attempt to maximize the KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence between the speaker's flat prior and the expected posterior over the listener's feature preferences $f$, integrating over all hypothetically possible state observations $s \in S$: %\gcs{can we assume a uniform cost and then remove $C(u)$ from our equations, mentioning this move in a footnote?}
$$P_{S_2}(u) \propto \sum_{s:\  [\![u]\!](s)=1} P_{L_1}(s|u,f)\ \exp(\lambda \cdot \textrm{KL}(P(f)\mid\mid P_{S_{2}}(f\mid u,s))),$$
where the factor $\lambda$ scales the importance of the KL divergence term. 


We evaluate two versions of the model. 
fullPSIRSA assumes the deep reasoning process specified above. 
It thus assumes that feature preference inference not only considers the current object choices possible, but also differentiates the choice options further with respect to their pragmatic plausibility. 
For example, fullPSIRSA includes modeling the fact that when a speaker utters ``blue'' in the object situation depicted in the example in Figure~\ref{FG-ref-game} and has the intention to refer to one particular object, she is more likely to refer to the blue square than to the blue circle, because in the latter case the utterance choice ``circle'' would have been unambiguous and thus a better utterance choice.


Recently, it has been shown that even in the original, simpler reference games, fewer layers of reasoning often perform equally well or better than more complex RSA-based models \cite{sikos2019}.
Accordingly, simplePSIRSA removes the reasoning about alternative utterances and allows the pragmatic speaker to directly tap into the (expected) interpretation of $L_0$, augmenting the literal listener's choice likelihoods with the feature-preference-dependent object prior $P(s\mid f)$:
$$P_{L_{0\textrm{-simp}}}(s\mid u,f) \propto \sem{$u$}(s) \cdot P(s\mid f).$$
The pragmatic speaker $S_{s\textrm{-simp}}$ then reasons directly about the modified literal listener $L_{0\textrm{-simp}}$: 
$$P_{S_{1\textrm{-simp}}}(f\mid u,s) \propto P_{L_{0\textrm{-simp}}}(s\mid u,f) \cdot P(f).$$
As a result, simplePSIRSA ignores any indirect pragmatic reasoning considerations about which object the speaker may refer to given an utterance and a particular object constellation.
It simply assumes that all objects may be chosen that match the utterance, modifying these choice options dependent on the feature-preference-dependent object choice priors. The corresponding utterance-selection model also simplifies the reasoning process:
$$P_{S_1\textrm{-simp}}(u) \propto \sum_{s:\  [\![u]\!](s)=1} P_{L_0}(s|u,f)\ \exp(\lambda \cdot \textrm{KL}(P(f)\mid\mid P_{S_{1\textrm{-simp}}}(f\mid u,s))),$$
In the evaluation section below, we compare the modeling performance of fullPSIRSA with simplePSIRSA. 

% In fact, their simplified model with only an enhanced $L_0$ equipped with an informative prior outperformed the full vanilla RSA model when it came to predicting interpretation behavior, suggesting that participants engage in shallower reasoning than predicted by the full-blown RSA. We therefore compare the predictions of our full pragmatic model with those of a simplified model.


%To test our model, we need to evaluate two main predictions of PSIRSA:  
%first, the pragmatic speaker's inference about the listener's feature preferences on the basis of observed object choices in particular situations $P_{S_{2}}(f\mid u,s)$; 
%second, the pragmatic speaker's strategic utterance selection $P_{S_2}(u)$ in light of the anticipated information gain about the listener's preferences considering the possible object choices.
%Before presenting the experimental and modeling results, though, we introduce a simplification of fullPSIRSA. 

%\subsection*{Simplified pragmatic social inference RSA}



% the pragmatic model with the following simplified social inference model, which removes this pragmatic reasoning aspect.


\subsection*{Experiment 1}
Our first task is to check the inferences of the pragmatic speaker having observed that a listener selects some object $s$ in response to an utterance $u$. 
Is it possible to draw inferences about the most likely preferences the listener had when making her choice? 
Can this inference process be modeled by PSIRSA---that is, by recursive, Bayesian generative modeling?

\subsubsection*{Models with global optimization}

We fit the following free parameters to optimized the predictions of the models. First, the full model includes a ``greediness'' parameter $\alpha$ that controls how likely participants are to choose an optimal utterance to signal an object to a speaker. This parameter is absent in the simple model since it relies on fewer layers of reasoning. The second parameter $\gamma$ controls how soft the preferences are. 
Hard preferences enforce the choice of the preferred object type, while increasing softness covnerges towards no object preference. 
Similarly, the obedience parameter $\beta$ allows subjects to choose objects that do not qualify for the utterance. 
As for the preference parameter $\gamma$, the $\beta$ range includes hard obedience on the one side of the spectrum -- for example, definitely choosing a blue object when hearing ``blue'' -- and full ignorance of the utterance at the other extreme -- for example, choosing uniformly from all available objects. 
%the , for example, subjects will consider objects that are not blue upon hearing ``blue''.


% We first present results for the globally-optimized versions of  PSIRSA .
% I used the code length(levels(as.factor(uniqueCCode))) to calculate the number of conditions
%Since not all of the stimuli allowed for inference of preferences in the same way, we introduced a new categorization of stimuli. Our base model would then predict the same preferences for the same category of stimuli. The categorization takes into account the distribution of features, the chosen object and which feature was uttered. Each category consists of 3 tuples of 2 digits. Each tuple refers to one feature, where the first tuple always refers to the uttered feature. The first digit in each tuple would then denote how many objects share the value of the picked object for the corresponding feature. In figure \ref{FG-ref-game}, if the utterance was blue and the blue square was picked, the first tuple would reference color and its first digit would be a "2". Note that this does not determine which other object shares the feature value, i.e. "blue". To compensate, the second digit of the tuple denotes which other object shares this value. This depends on the order of the objects---we stipulated that the picked object would be the first. The further order would be determined by which other object shares this specific value, i.e. the "blue circle" in figure \ref{FG-ref-game} would be the first of the "other objects" and the "green square" the second. The picked object is at position zero in this sense. Thus the first tuple for figure \ref{FG-ref-game} would be (2,1). For the other tuples, the first digits would be "2" for shape and "3" for texture. To streamline the category code we stipulated that we would order the features in descending order of their first digit, so that we would have texture's "3" next in figure \ref{FG-ref-game}. If a tuple starts with "3" or "1", the second digit would simply denote whether the other objects have different values for that feature or the same. Thus we would have (3,2) for texture, with the second digit signaling that the non-picked objects share their texture. The tuple for shape would finally be (2,2), because the value "square" is shared with the second other object (see above). Thus for figure \ref{FG-ref-game} we would end up with [(2,1),(3,2),(2,2)].
simplePSIRSA and fullPSIRSA with softness ($\gamma$) optimized globally provide nearly identically good fits to the data  (Figure~\ref{simple-global-and-cross-validated}).
simplePSIRSA yields a correlation of $r^2 = 0.8614$ when only softness parameter $\gamma$ is optimized ($\gamma=0.2204$ after optimization).\footnote{All correlations were highly significant, that is, $p < 0.001$, if not stated differently in the text.} 
When both parameters are optimized globally, a correlation of $r^2 = 0.9789$ is reached
($\gamma=0.2210$ and $\beta=0.2693$ after optimization), indicating that participants indeed considered (possibly subconsciously) the option to interpret utterances non-literally.

% $\gamma$ and $\beta$ optimized: Multiple R-squared:  0.9789; gamma=0.2210127, beta=0.2692707
fullPSIRSA yields nearly identical values.
When optimizing only the softness parameter $\gamma$, a correlation of $r^2 = 0.8576$ is reached ($\gamma=0.2231$).

Overall, the results show that participants are indeed able to infer the feature preferences that lead to the choice of an object.%, and, notably, simplePSIRSA models this inference process very well.
Moreover, the higher model flexibility of fullPSIRSA---controlled via parameter $\alpha$---does not yield any modeling improvement, implying that an approximation of the more shallow reasoning process modeled by simplePSIRSA typically unfolded in the minds of the participants.

\subsubsection*{Individually-fitted models}

We now compare our two model variants further when fitting the parameters to the individual data of each participant separately. 
We optimized $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ in the light of the KL divergence between the individual participants' slider value choices and the corresponding model predictions for PSIRSA.
We then again averaged the individualized model prediction values and participants' slider values with respect to the particular ambiguity classes and calculated correlations between the data and the model.


%Figure~\ref{simple-full-individual} shows that 
The full model optimized at the individual level for the additional parameter $\alpha$ does not improve the fit compared to the simplified model (simplePSIRSA: $r^{2}=0.8631$; fullPSIRSA: $r^{2}=0.8614$). 
Seeing that both models again fit the data nearly equally well (if anything, simplePSIRSA performs slightly better), we will henceforth only consider the predictions of simplePSIRSA.
Note further that the individually-fitted parameters do not improve the correlation values much, if at all, when compared to the globally-fitted model. 


%the For example, if a $S_2$ observes that following an utterance $blue$ and three objects all three of which are blue, but all differ in shape, the speaker chooses a square, the speaker might conclude that the $L_1$  has a preference for squares. However, the exact value on the slider the $S_2$ picks depends on the $\gamma$ parameter: if it is close to $0$, the speaker will mark that the $L_1$ had a perefernce for squares close to $1$. As the parameter value increases, the softness of preference will increase as well, drawing the preference value towards uniform (uninformative).
%he model contains three parameters: the informativity paramter $\alpha$ (how informative speakers choose to be), the obey-instructions parameter $\beta$, and the softness of preferences parameter $\gamma$. The latter 

% \gcs{We need to say something about how we fit individual participant data. How exactly where the parameter values fit? What were candidate values?}

% \end{figure}



%When compared to the uniform-distribution base model, optimizing $\gamma$ alone yielded a much lower KL divergence value: while the uniform base model yields an average KL divergence of $9.848$ (median=$7.028$), our extended RSA model with individually-optimized $\gamma$ parameters yielded an average KL divergence of $2.058$ (median=$1.524$). 
%When optimizing $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ together, a yet smaller average KL divergence of $1.451$ (median=$0.952$) is reached.
%In the light of the $G^2$ statistics and under the assumption that we calculated $2$ KL divergences in all $15$ trials per participant, the KL values should be multiplied by $2*15*2=60$ to yield a $G^2$ estimate, although one may want to consider the two KL divergences in each trial as closely related, such that $2*15=30$ may be considered as a more passive multiplier.


%With this factor, we get a difference of $233.7$ between the uniform base model and the one-parameter extended RSA model, while the additional optimization of $\alpha$ improves $G^2$ further by a value of $18.21$. Both of these results are far above the cutoff value of $6.63$ for $p=.01$, assuming a Chi-square distribution \cite{Lewandowsky:2011}. 
%Thus, the extended model exceeds the uniform base model with very high likelihood. 
%However, considering the much smaller improvement due to the additional optimization of $\alpha$, we analyze correlations with respect to the one-parameter (i.e., $\gamma$-optimized) model in what follows. 

%When considering the distribution of optimized parameters, we can identify three participants who cause the optimization process to yield $\gamma$ values above $100$, indicating lazy participants who simply leave the slider values unadjusted. 
%Another 15 participants yielded a $\gamma$ value above $1$, which indicates that they are considering preferences only to a small extent. The rest (i.e., 64 participants) yielded values below $1$, indicating a strong consideration of preference inferences in line with the model. 
 
%We compared  in the light of the distinguishable interpretation cases. 

The model fit improves considerably when we additionally fit the obedience parameter $\beta$ at the individual level. 
%We plot predictions from the $\beta$- and $\gamma$-optimized model in Figure~\ref{cross-validation}, 
Here we found the strongest positive correlation between the human judgments and model predictions ($r^2 = 0.992$). The likelihood ratio test revealed that a $\gamma$- and $\beta$-optimized simplePSIRSA model provides a better fit compared to a model optimized only for $\gamma$ ($G^2 = 237.36, \textrm{df} = 82, p < 0.01$). The more complex model contains one additional parameter $\beta$ fitted for each subject, giving us 82 degrees of freedom. We additionally checked the generalizability of the model by performing leave-one-out cross-validation. Figure~\ref{simple-global-and-cross-validated} shows that the resulting cross-validated model predictions retain the strong correlation ($r^{2}=0.9901$).

%\end{figure}


To appreciate the gains obtained by fitting model parameters, Figure~\ref{barplot_x4} shows the average responses of the human participants and of the individually-, two-parameter-optimized simplePSIRSA model and the non-optimized simplePSIRSA model for the scene type of the sample trial from Figure~\ref{exp1-trial}.
In that trial, participants saw that the middle object was chosen following the utterance ``red". There are two potential referents for this description: the red striped cloud and the red dotted circle. Since the cloud was chosen, we infer that the person who chose this object has a preference for clouds over circles, and for striped objects over dotted ones. 
Note that we cannot learn anything about the preference for solid things or squares in this trial because these features are not present, thus we ignore the respective slider values. 
Moreover, we can definitely not learn anything about color preferences because the color was the uttered, thus sliders for those features were not present.  
As Figure~\ref{barplot_x4} shows, both humans and the models assign high slider values to clouds and striped things, and low values to circles and dotted things. Indeed, even the non-optimized model fits the qualitative pattern of the results; optimizing $\beta$ and $\gamma$ improves the quantitative fit.

\end{figure}


We thus find strong empirical support for simplePSIRSA, implying that speakers are indeed able to use listener behavior to acquire information about their preferences. We fail to find that the fullPSIRSA model predicts the data better.
This result suggests that the task in our experiments does not require full-blown pragmatic inference about alternative utterances.
% Martin: let's leave this statement out - it may annoy reviewers: 
% , in contrast with \citeA{frankgoodman2012} but in line with \citeA{sikos2019}. 
%There speakers needed to signal a particular object to the listener, while in our experiments the intention of the speaker is quite different: she produces an utterance to create a situation of ambiguity resolution. In turn, it is not the listener's goal to infer what object was intended as a referent; rather the listener picks an object according to her preferences.
The question now turns to whether speakers are able to capitalize on this reasoning when it comes to selecting utterances. In other words, are speakers aware that ambiguous language is potentially more informative?

\subsection*{Experiment 2: Choosing utterances to learn about others}

Our next task is to check the predictions of our strategic utterance selection model: given a set of potential referents $S$, are participants able to reason pragmatically about the anticipated potential epistemic utility of utterances $u\in U$ in inferring the listener's preferences? Figure \ref{exp2-trial} shows a sample trial, in which the speaker (``Katie'' in the example) is to choose an utterance in order to learn about the listener's preferences (``Elizabeth'' in the example). While the ambiguous utterances ``cloud'', ``green'', and ``striped'' may allow inferences about color \& texture, shape \& texture, and color \& shape, respectively, the utterances ``solid'', ``blue'', and ``circle'' leave only one response option to the listener, such that the speaker cannot learn about the listener's preferences when observing the listener's response (assuming the listener obeys the speaker's order).  


\begin{figure*}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{images/utterance-choice-trial.png}
	\caption{A sample trial from \emph{Experiment 2: Choosing utterances}. }\label{exp2-trial}
\end{figure*} 

By reasoning about the predictions of $S_2$, we are able to use simplePSIRSA to compute the expected most informative utterance for inferring preferences.
In other words, $P_{S_1\textrm{-simp}}(u)$ calculates the probability that a speaker would choose $u$ for the purpose of inferring preferences.

To generate predictions from $P_{S_1\textrm{-simp}}(u)$, three free parameters can be identified:
the preference softness $\gamma$, the obedience $\beta$, and a $\lambda$ parameter, which factors the importance of choosing the expected most informative utterance with respect to the expected KL divergence between preference priors and expected preference posteriors.
Note that negative values for $\lambda$ results in a minimization of expected information gain, effectively favoring unambiguous utterances. 
Moreover, when $\lambda=0$, the model collapses to an approximate uniform distribution over the available utterances.
%\gcs{is this true? Will utterances that can describe more objects be preferred?}. Asya: verified with Martin, the description is correct.


%The proper model fit is confirmed when considering the correlation between the participants' data and the model predictions. 

We compare simplePSIRSA with non-optimized parameters and with several parameter optimizations with the performance of a uniform base model, which simply chooses one of the available utterances at random. 
Seeing that in particular ambiguity cases with particular constellations $S$ three up to nine utterances are possible, the base model yields different model predictions for the available utterances in the respective ambiguity classes. 
As a result, the correlation performance of the uniform base model is much better than one would expect without this insight ($r^2=0.7467$, $p<0.001$).
Figure~\ref{base-nonopt-x3} compares this performance to the non-optimized simplePSIRSA, where we set the parameters to hard preference and obedience ($\gamma=0$, $\beta=0$) and the information gain factor to $\lambda=1$, thus preferring to choose those utterances that are expected to yield high information gain. 
Surprisingly, this model fully fails to predict the human data ($r^2=0.0595$, $p=0.0144$)


To examine the reasons for this failure, we ran additional global parameter optimization runs.
When optimizing all the model parameters, the correlation outperforms the uniform base model ($r^2=0.7991$, $p<0.001$; optimized model parameters: $\gamma=0.0006$, $\beta=0.2758$, $\lambda=0.3663$).
Moreover, the nested model comparison test with three free parameters yields a G2 value of $13.6912$, which indicates a more accurate model with $p<0.004$. 
Figure~\ref{global-individual-x3} shows the correlation plot. 
The parameters indicate that the preference strength is rather high, obedience is not as strong, while the information gain intention is visible. 
We now turn to individual parameter optimization, suspecting that their may be fundamental differences between the individual groups of workers. 



%Figure \ref{exp2-results} plots predictions from the $\lambda$-optimized model, together with the human data. Again, we observe a strong positive correlation between the human judgments and model predictions ($r^2 = 0.91, p < 0.001$). In other words, we find evidence in support of the idea that speakers reason pragmatically about the relative informativity of ambiguous language.

\end{figure}

% I recorded the same number of conditions as in Experiment 1. I think Experiment 2 used the same ambiguity code.

%The results for the base model yielded an average KL divergence value of $5.415$ (median=$3.997$), while the $\lambda$-optimized model yielded a mean KL divergence of $3.774$ (median=$2.108$).
%Again determining $G^2$ to enable a Chi-square test for significant model differences in fitting the data, the difference between the base model and one-parameter model (factored by $2*15=30$) of $49.23$ (median difference of $56.67$) is highly significant, indicating that the one-parameter model fits the data much better than a uniform base model. 
% Note: these interesting observations may not be mentioned _ I leave them in for now because the discussion can relate to them 


We compared three single-parameter-individually-optimized simplePSIRSA models to determine which model provides the best fit to the data. 
All models have similar levels of complexity, with either softness $\gamma$, obedience $\beta$, or KL-factor $\lambda$ being optimized.
The results indicate that we get the best fit by optimizing the KL-factor $\lambda$ ($r^{2}=0.9071$; leave-one-out cross-validated optimization $r^{2}=0.8902$), with other models capturing less variance in the data ($\beta$-optimized $r^{2}=0.8039$; $\gamma$-optimized $r^{2}=0.8100$).
Two- and three-parameter individual optimizations did not yield any significant model improvements (best improvement when optimizing $\gamma$ in addition to $\lambda$, with a G2 value of $24.72$, which is not significant when considering the $82$ additional degrees of freedom due to individual parameter optimization).
% were unstable due to parameter interactions; therefore, we do not report the results for those models.

\end{figure}


Unlike for Experiment 1 where even the non-optimized models provided a good linear fit to the data, optimization produces a large effect on the model predictions in Experiment 2. Figure~\ref{barplot_x3} compares individually-optimized vs.~non-optimized model predictions against the human behavior for the sample trial in Figure~\ref{exp2-trial}. We see that the non-optimized model strongly favors ambiguous utterances: in a situation with a striped green circle, a blue striped cloud, and a solid green cloud, uttering things like \textit{cloud}, \textit{striped}, or \textit{green} (i.e., the utterances that point to more than one object in the scene) and could let the speaker learn something about the listener's preferences. However, Figure~\ref{barplot_x3} shows that human behavior deviates quite strongly from the non-optimized, ambiguity-selecting baseline; once we optimize $\lambda$, we are able to capture human behavior in the task.
%For example, \textit{green} picks out two objects: a striped green circle and a solid green cloud; after saying ``green'', the speaker could learn whether the listener prefers striped things over solid things, or circles over clouds.

% Note: I did check it - there are indeed 14. 5+5+6+7+6+6+7+3+4+5+6+7+8+9
%After matching the respective actual feature values with the utterance choice relevant within the respectively-binned conditions, we again computed averages over utterance preference values for the respectively-binned trials across participants and across respective model predictions \gcs{this is awfully hard to follow}. Asya: decided to remove this part, reordering can just as well stay behind the scenes.

% Asya: Need to fix the text below 
%In Figure~\ref{kl-factor}, 
%In Figure \ref{kl-factor}, we compare $\lambda$-optimized simplePSIRSA (right panel) with a uniform base model (left panel), which assigns equal probability to each utterance available for a particular context.
%This baseline model essentially has no utterance  preferences whatsoever, but reflects the fact that the ambiguity classes distinguish between cases with a different number of utterance choice options (i.e., three to nine).
 %\gcs{why is this a reasonable model to compare against? I think we need to do more to motivate this comparison.}. 
 %\gcs{how is this model defined?} Asya: it really is a model that takes the probability of 1 and distributes it evenly between all possible utterances.
 %Since simplePSIRSA with $\lambda=0$ collapses to the baseline model, optimizing the $\lambda$ %parameter in simplePSIRSA is a nested model. 
 %When statistically comparing the individually-optimized $\lambda$ simplePSIRSA model with the baseline model, the likelihood ratio test confirms that individual $\lambda$ optimizations yield better fits than the baseline model ($G^2 = 268.87, \textrm{df} = 82, p <0.01$).

When examining the individually optimized parameter values $\lambda$, we noticed that three groups of participants could be distinguised. 
% on the basis of the individually-optimized parameter values of $\lambda$. 
The first one is a ``lazy worker'' group of $18$ participants whose fitted $\lambda$ values were close to zero (i.e.,  $-.02 < \lambda<.02$), indicating that they were randomly selecting utterances.
The second group of $32$ participants yielded more negative values (i.e., $-7.13<\lambda<-.02$), indicating that a significant number of participants preferred to systematically choose unambiguous utterances. 
The third group of again $32$ participants yielded more positive values (i.e., $.02<\lambda<.54$), indicating that these participants indeed chose the most ambiguous utterance in a strategic manner. 



\section*{Discussion}

We have found strong support for PSIRSA, which infers preference posteriors on the basis of ambiguous language.
% \gcs{we might want to talk about this as ``priors'' in the introduction as well} Asya: added a new section to the Intro
The results of Experiment~1 demonstrate that na\"ive speakers are able to reason pragmatically about \emph{why} listeners may take the actions they do. 
The success of our computational model in predicting the observed behavior offers an articulated hypothesis about \emph{how} this reasoning proceeds: when speakers are aware of the ambiguity in their utterances, observing how listeners resolve that ambiguity provides clues to the preferences listeners use when doing so.
The results of Experiment 2 demonstrate that at least some speakers are able to capitalize on this reasoning to strategically select ambiguous utterances that are most likely to inform their understanding of the preferences of their listeners.
However, this group of ambiguity-selecting participants included only about $40\%$ of the participants. 
Further experiments with highly similar setups (not reported in detail here) confirmed this trend. 
In particular, we ran a complementary study with a blocked design where participants first completed preference-inferences trials as in Experiment~1 and then completed utterance-selection trials as in Experiment~2. 
Even in such an experimental setup, the trend stayed the same. 
Currently, we are transferring the experimental setup to more naturalistic interaction scenarios. 
Even in these cases, though, it appears that we still find participants who consistently prefer to choose unambiguous utterances. 
Two explanations may be warranted and need to be investigated further. 
First, it may be the case that these participants think overly egocentrically, thus having the intention to signal their own preferences rather than to give options to the listener. 
Second, it may simply be the case that these participants do not have access to the required deeper reasoning process, and thus prefer to give instructions with predictable outcomes. 
% \gcs{it might be good to speculate as to why only some of our participants selected ambiguous utterances: misunderstanding instructions, inability to follow instructions, or perhaps some other factor}

Nonetheless, taken together, the results of our experiments and the success of our model in predicting those results indicate that humans are aware of the fact that by observing responses to ambiguous utterances, information about the listener's prior preferences can be inferred---that is, they are able to learn about the hidden model states of others, including preferences but probably also other aspects of beliefs. 
It should also be noted that ambiguous utterances used in this way to learn about others are closely related to questions, which may ask directly about considered preferences. 
Ambiguous utterances provide a ready but more subtle, indirect alternative to asking directly. 
In normal conversations, a speaker might favor the indirect route, given considerations of politeness and possibly also in an effort to keep the conversation open. 
With ambiguous language, the conversation partner can choose to disambiguate the ambiguous utterance or, alternatively, choose to continue in a different direction or even to change topic.


We note that the analyzed preference prior, viewed from a broader perspective, can be closely related to a part of the event-predictive mind of the listener and the speaker \cite{Butz:2016,Butz:2017}. 
When interpreting an utterance---in our case, opening up a set of referent choices---the listener's mind infers the current choices and integrates them with her preference priors, implicitly anticipating possible choice consequences.
Moreover, the expected information gain term---computing the utterance choice of the speaker---can be equated with the computation of socially-motivated active inference \cite{Butz:2017a,Friston:2015}.
It causes the model to strive for an anticipated epistemic value that quantifies the expected information gain about the preferences of the listener---that is, expecting a form of social information gain. 


More generally, predictive states of mind about others do not only include considerations of the preferences of others, but may also concern all imaginable knowledge, opinions, beliefs, current trains of thought, and preferences of the listener.
Moreover, during a conversation, the involved ``social'' priors will dynamically develop depending on the internal predictive models and the generated utterances, actions, and responses of the speaker and listener. 
The priors dynamically depend on the privileged grounds of the conversational partners, and also on the common ground in which the conversation unfolds.
In that sense, ambiguous utterances are one device for projecting parts of each other's privileged grounds into the common ground. 


%Moreover, there 
%in conversation the priors dynamically unfold according to beliefs and preferences about the world and speakers
%twin anecdote, politeness (why not ask directly?)
%is ambiguity a feature that evolved under pressure from these considerations (i.e., informing preferences), or did ambiguity predate these considerations and speakers merely figured out clever ways of capitalizing on it---a lemonade-out-of-lemons scenario?

\section*{Methods}


\subsection*{Experiment 1: Learning about others' preferences}

\subsubsection*{Participants}

We recruited 90 participants with US IP addresses through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service. Participants were compensated for their participation. On the basis of a post-test demographics questionnaire, we identified 82 participants as native speakers of English; their data were included in the analyses reported below.

\subsubsection*{Design and methods}

We presented participants with a series of reference game scenarios modeled after Figure~\ref{FG-ref-game} from \citeA{frankgoodman2012}.
Each scenario featured two people and three objects.
One of the people served as the speaker, and the other served as the listener. The speaker asks the listener to choose one of the objects, but in doing so she is allowed to mention only one of the features of the target object. Participants were told that the listener might have a preference for certain object features, and participants were tasked with inferring those preferences after observing the speaker's utterance and listener's object choice.

We followed \citeA{frankgoodman2012} in our stimuli creation. Objects were allowed to vary along three dimensions: color (blue, red, green), shape (cloud, circle, square), and pattern (solid, striped, polka-dotted). The speaker's utterance was chosen at random from the properties of the three objects present, and the listener's choice was chosen at random from the subset of the three objects that possesed the uttered feature. By varying the object properties, the targeted object, and the utterance, we generated a total of 2400 scenes. Speaker and listener names were chosen randomly in each trial. Participants saw the speaker's utterance in bold (e.g., ``red'' in Figure \ref{exp1-trial}) and the listener's choice appeared with a dotted orange outline (e.g., the center object in Figure \ref{exp1-trial}). Based on the observed choice, participants were instructed to adjust a series of six sliders to indicate how likely it is that the listener had a preference for a given feature. The sliders specified the six feature values of the two feature dimensions that were not mentioned in the speaker's utterance (e.g., pattern and shape in Figure \ref{exp1-trial}). 

Depending on how many features competitor objects share with the chosen object, we were able to identify 48 ambiguity classes, which group the constellations that have the exact same ambiguity constellation. Figure~\ref{exp1-trial} shows a few of those ambiguity classes with particular, exemplary, object-utterance-choice constellations.
%For example, considering the top-left-most case, ,where the utterance ``red" refers to two possible objects and the choice falls onto one of them (here the red cloud), which shares one property with the other, not referenced object (its cloud shape), but no further properties with the other referenced object (neither its shape nor its pattern). Thus, its other property is unique (its striped pattern)
%If, as an alternative scenario, he utterance was ``green", only one object would qualify (the green, dotted cloud), preventing the learning about preferences. 
%In that case, the model would assign equal probability to the listener's preferring dotted objects, striped objects, clouds, and squares. 
%Once the model establishes that more than one object can be picked, it also needs to consider whether alternative objects share their features with the target object. For example, if both red objects were also striped, the model would not be able to infer any preferences about the pattern. 
%In addition to these considerations, ambiguity classes also distinguish whether the objects that are not referenced by the utterance share any of their feature values.

Participants completed a series of fifteen trials. Objects and utterances were chosen as detailed above, with the constraint that ten trials were potentially informative with respect to listener preferences and five trials were uninformative with respect to listener preferences (e.g., observing that the listener chose one of three identical objects).

\subsection*{Experiment 2}

\subsubsection*{Participants}

We recruited $90$ participants with US IP addresses through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service; participants in Experiment 1 were not eligible to participate in Experiment 2. Participants were compensated for their participation. On the basis of a post-test demographics questionnaire, we again identified 82 participants as native speakers of English; their data were included in the analyses.

\subsubsection*{Design and methods}

Participants encountered a reference game scenario similar to Experiment 1 in which a speaker signals an object to a listener who might have a preference for certain types of objects. However, rather than observing the utterance and referent choice, participants were now tasked with helping the speaker choose an utterance that was ``most likely to reveal the listener's color, shape, or pattern preferences.''

We used the same sets of objects from Experiment 1, which could vary along three dimensions. Each trial featured a set of three objects, as in Figure \ref{exp2-trial}. After observing the objects, participants adjusted sliders to indicate which single-feature utterance the speaker should choose to learn about the preferences of their listener. Potential utterances corresponded to the features of the objects present; depending on the number of unique features, participants adjusted between three and nine sliders. As with Experiment 1, we averaged the data and the respective model predictions across specific ambiguity classes, which include all scenes that yield identical utterance choice options. 
In this case, $14$ distinct conditions can be identified, with a total of $84$ slider values to set. 
Membership within an ambiguity class is defined by how many objects in a scene share each of the features: shape, pattern, and color. If objects share a feature, we also consider whether these objects also share other features. For example, in Figure \ref{exp2-trial}, two green objects differ in shape, making the utterance \textit{green} informative. If, on the other hand, both green objects were clouds, uttering \textit{green} would not allow the speaker to update their beliefs about the listener's shape preferences.
In the most extreme case, when all objects share all three features, all utterances are ambiguous since multiple objects can always be picked; but no utterance allows the speaker to learn anything about the listener because the object choice is uninformative. Another extreme case is a situation where all objects are unique and do not share any features. In such a case, any utterance will only pick one object, making learning about preferences impossible unless obedience ($\beta$) is not 0---that is, unless listeners have a tendency to disobey the utterance and consider objects that do not satisfy its literal interpretation.

Participants completed a series of fifteen trials. As with Experiment 1, objects were chosen at random, with the constraint that ten trials were potentially informative with respect to the listener's preferences (as in Figure~\ref{exp2-trial}) and five trials were uninformative with respect to the listener's preferences (e.g., observing a set of three identical objects).


\subsection*{Modeling: fullPSIRSA}

We use $L_0$ and $S_1$ from the vanilla model, but we now parameterize $L_1$'s state prior such that it operates given a feature preference $f$:
$$P_{L_{1}}(s\mid u,f) \propto P_{S_{1}}(u \mid s) \cdot P(s \mid f).$$
We then model a pragmatic speaker $S_2$, who updates beliefs about $L_1$'s preferences, $P(f)$.
$S_2$ observes $L_1$'s choice of $s$ given the produced utterance $u$ and then reasons about the likely feature preference $f$ that $L_1$ used to make the observed choice:
$$P_{S_{2}}(f\mid u,s) \propto P_{L_{1}}(s \mid u,f) \cdot P(f).$$

We also model the reasoning process by which a speaker may select the best utterance to learn about the preferences of the listener, essentially striving to maximize expected information gain concerning the listener's feature preferences.
Starting with no knowledge of the listener's preferences, $S_2$ can be assumed to expect a uniform (i.e., flat) feature preference prior $P(f)$.
The more the speaker's posterior beliefs about the preferences, $P_{S_{2}}(f\mid u,s)$, deviate from the uniform prior, the more the speaker will have learned about the listener's preferences. 
We can thus model this reasoning in light of expected information gain, which can be equated with the attempt to maximize the KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence between the speaker's flat prior and the expected posterior over the listener's feature preferences $f$, integrating over all hypothetically possible state observations $s \in S$: %\gcs{can we assume a uniform cost and then remove $C(u)$ from our equations, mentioning this move in a footnote?}
$$P_{S_2}(u) \propto \sum_{s:\  [\![u]\!](s)=1} P_{L_1}(s|u,f)\ \exp(\lambda \cdot \textrm{KL}(P(f)\mid\mid P_{S_{2}}(f\mid u,s))),$$
where the factor $\lambda$ scales the importance of the KL divergence term. 

\subsection*{Optimization procedure}

%\subsubsection*{Experiment 1}

To compare PSIRSA's predictions to the human data, we calculated an average value for each slider, binning data into 48 ambiguity classes for Experiment 1 and 14 classes for Experiment 2. We excluded the sliders if their corresponding feature value was not present in a scene. For example, for the trial depicted in Figure \ref{exp1-trial}, we excluded the sliders for solid things and squares since none of these are present, and therefore no learning about them is possible.
%We binned those scene types 
%For all scene types, the actual feature values and objects in a scene were reordered according to the specific preference inference involved \gcs{I'm not sure what you mean here}. 
%Thus, after reordering, the results of the individual slider values for individual scenes in each scene type could be averaged for both the participant data and the model predictions. 

We fit the model parameters either at the individual level or at the group level by optimizing the KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence between the data and the model predictions:

$$\textrm{KL}(P_{data}(f \mid u,s)\mid\mid (P_{model}(f\mid u,s)),$$

\noindent where $P_{data}(f\mid u,s)$ specifies a participant's normalized slider value setting, which offers empirical estimates of the feature-preference posterior given object scene $S$, a particular utterance choice $u$, and the consequent object choice $s$;
$P_{model}(f\mid u,s)$ specifies the corresponding model posterior, either $P_{S_{2}}(f\mid u,s)$ in the case of fullPSIRSA or $P_{S_{1\textrm{-simp}}}(f\mid u,s)$ in the case of simplePSIRSA. 
%Since no conclusions can be drawn concerning feature values that are not present in the scene, we ignored the respective feature preference estimates.
By minimizing the KL divergence between the empirical and model-predicted preference posteriors for each participant, we maximize the model fit to the participants' data. 
Moreover, we can use the minimized KL divergence values to perform the likelihood ratio test for nested models relying on the $G^2$-statistic, because the summed KL divergence values are approximately chi-square distributed \cite{Lewandowsky:2011}. 
Individual vs.~global-level parameter fitting allows us to explore potential differences between participants, and, more importantly, to evaluate whether the Gricean reasoning strategies apply at the level of individual speakers or only to the population as a whole \cite{franke2016reasoning}. 

We fit three parameters for fullPSIRSA and two for simplePSIRSA.
%We hypothesized that participants may either go through all the layers of pragmatic reasoning, and additionally calculate the preferences that lead to particular object choice. The last layer of this model $S_2$ returns a posterior distribution over inferred feature preferences $f$ after observing a listener selecting an object in response to an utterance. 
%In a simpler model, the object choice is driven only by a $L_0$ semantics enhanced with priors over feature preferences. Upon hearing an utterance \textit{blue} a participants assigns equal probabilities to all blue objects in a scene, and the actual choice of object signals a preference of other feature values that object has. For example, picking a blue circle rather than a blue square is driven by a prefrence for circles.
The soft-max scaling factor $\alpha$ is only relevant for fullPSIRSA; it  controls how likely speaker $S_1$ is to maximize utility when choosing utterances. 
The default value is typically set to $\alpha=1$ (i.e., no scaling). 


The softness parameter $\gamma$ regulates the strength of individual feature preferences $f$:
$$ P(s \mid f) \propto \begin{cases}
1 + \gamma, & \text{if}\ s\ \text{contains}\ f \\
\gamma, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases},$$
controlling the choice probability of those objects $s$ that contain feature $f$ compared to those that do not.  
A value of $\gamma=0$ models a hard preference choice; in this case, the speaker always chooses one of the preferred objects. 
On the other hand, when $\gamma \rightarrow \infty$, the choice prior becomes uniform over all objects, thus ignoring feature preferences. 
% That is, a large value of $\gamma$ approximates uniform prior feature preferences.
% I tried to write it in a more general form that works for both P = 0 and P = 1 but I'm not sure that works.
% This is the R code:
%objectPreferenceSoftPriors[[utt]] <- objectPreferenceHardPriors[[utt]] + softAddProb
%objectPreferenceSoftPriors[[utt]] <- objectPreferenceSoftPriors[[utt]] / sum(objectPreferenceSoftPriors[[utt]])
%$$ P(s_{\textrm{cloud}}\mid f_{\textrm{cloud}}) = \frac{1 + \gamma}{1 + 3\gamma}$$
% This is what we wrote. It makes sense for P = 1 but I'm not sure the numbers come out right when we calculate how softness changes the probability of objects that don't qualify.
For example, in the trial shown in Figure~\ref{exp1-trial}, there are two objects that fit the utterance $u=\text{``red''}$: a red striped cloud and a red dotted circle.
When $\gamma=1$, $P(s_{\textrm{red\ striped\ cloud}}\mid f_{\textrm{``cloud''}}) = 2/3$, while
$P(s_{\textrm{red\ dotted\ circle}}\mid f_{\textrm{``cloud''}})= 1/3$, yielding a soft preference for clouds.
% The softness parameter $\gamma$ regulates the probability that the middle object will be picked if a person has a preference for clouds. 
%Preference softness increases with $\gamma$: 
%a value of $\gamma=0$ specifies a hard preference, which means that the listener will always choose the object that holds the preferred feature value if possible (e.g., clouds when clouds are preferred). 
We assume $\gamma=0$---that is, hard preferences---as the default model value.
%Let us see how the probability changes if $\gamma$ is set to 0.2:
% $$ P(s_{\textrm{cloud}}\mid f_{\textrm{cloud}}) = \frac{1 + 0.2}{1 + 3 \cdot 0.2} = 0.75$$
%Here the preference becomes softer: a subject will pick up clouds with a probability of 0.75 rather than 1.
%On the other hand, $\gamma \rightarrow \infty$ specifies a uniform feature value preference, or no actual preference. 

%The softness parameter $\gamma$ determines how strong a preference is if a certain feature value is indeed preferred.
%such that the RSA models can be viewed as being nested within the default model.
% Note: I removed $\beta$ because it complicates things enormously and proved to be not really relevant.

Finally, we allow for the possibility of noise in our human data introduced by participants not following instructions.
Parameter $\beta$ models the possibility that listeners choose objects that do not pass the semantic filter of the literal listener, allowing for non-literal interpretations that result in choosing objects whose features do not match the received utterance $u$. 
The computation is equivalent to the softness parameter above, in this case softening the object choices of the literal listener $L_0$ towards a uniform choice over all objects present. 
%$$ P(s_{\textrm{x}}\mid u_{\textrm{x}}) = \frac{P(s\mid u) + \beta}{\sum P(s\mid u) + 3\beta}$$
Again, $\beta=0$ models a hard object choice---that is, full obedience to the uttered instruction $u$---while $\beta \rightarrow \infty$ models a uniform object choice---that is, full ignorance of $u$.
%As $\beta$ increases, speakers disregard instructions and assign non-zero probabilities to objects that do not correspond to the utterance; with $\beta = 0$, speakers fully obey the instructions and only consider objects with the named property (e.g., only red objects following the utterance \textit{red}).
