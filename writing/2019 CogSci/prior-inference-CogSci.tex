\section{Introduction}

Linguists often treat ambiguity as a bug in the communication system, something to be avoided or explained away \cite{grice1975,chomsky2002minimalism}. However, recent research has begun to take notice of the efficiency ambiguity affords us: by relying on context to fill in missing information, we can reuse lightweight bits of language rather than fully specifying the intended message \cite{levinson2000,piantadosietal2012,wasow2015}. In other words, ambiguity serves as a feature---not a bug---of an efficient communication system. This reasoning accords with years of psycholinguistic research documenting that speakers readily produce ambiguous utterances (see \citeNP{ferreira2008}, for an overview). 

The current work identifies an additional benefit afforded by using ambiguous language: the \emph{extra} information we gain from observing how our listeners resolve ambiguity. We advance the hypothesis that language users learn about each other's private knowledge by observing how they resolve ambiguity. If language does not do the job of specifying the information necessary for full interpretation, then listeners are left to draw on their beliefs and preferences to fill in the gaps; by observing how listeners fill those gaps in, speakers learn about the beliefs and preferences the listeners are using. 

By way of illustration, take, for example, the scenario in Fig.~\ref{FG-ref-game}. Suppose a speaker produces the single-word utterance ``blue'' in an attempt to signal one of the objects to a listener. The utterance is ambiguous; it can pick out either the blue square or the blue circle. Suppose further that, upon hearing ``blue,'' the listener selects the blue circle. In observing this choice, the speaker stands to learn something about the private thoughts of the listener: what made her select the blue circle instead of the blue square? Perhaps the circle is more salient to the listener, or the listener has a preference for circles, or the listener believes the speaker has a preference for circles. By observing how the listener resolves the ambiguity in reference, the speaker can learn this information.

However, accessing this added information requires the speaker to reason pragmatically about the pragmatic reasoning of the listener---a higher-order pragmatic reasoning, as it were. In order select a referent, the listener must interpret the utterance. We follow \citeA{frankgoodman2012} in treating this interpretation process as active pragmatic reasoning: the listener interprets the utterance by reasoning about the process that generated it, namely the speaker, who selects as utterance by reasoning about how a listener would interpret it. \citeauthor{frankgoodman2012} model this recursive social reasoning between speakers and listeners; their model serves as the launch point for the Rational Speech Act (RSA) modeling framework.

The current paper builds on the foundational, vanilla RSA model of reference games by introducing uncertainty about the prior beliefs of the listener and modeling a speaker who reasons about these beliefs on the basis of the observed referent choice. We begin by walking through our modeling assumptions, then presenting our model in full detail. We then test the behavioral predictions of our model against human data in a series of web-based experiments. We conclude with a discussion of the significance of our findings for understanding ambiguity in natural language.


\section{Model}

We begin with the vanilla RSA model of \citeA{frankgoodman2012}. The recursive social reasoning inherent to the RSA modeling framework gets cashed out as various layers of inference. At the base, there is a hypothetical, naive literal listener $L_0$ who hears an utterance $u$ and infers the state of the world $s$ that utterance is meant to describe. $L_0$ performs this inference by conditioning on the literal semantics of $u$, \sem{$u$}. $L_0$ thus returns a uniform distribution over those states $s$ that can be truthfully described by $u$:
$$P_{L_{0}}(s|u) \propto \sem{u}(s).$$
One layer up, the speaker $S_1$ observes some state $s$ and chooses an utterance $u$ to communicate that state to $L_0$. $S_1$ chooses utterances on the basis of their utility for signaling $s$ to $L_0$, $U_{S_1}(u;s)$. The speaker's utility maximizes the probability that $L_0$ would arrive at the correct $s$ on the basis of $u$, $P_{L_{0}}(s|u)$, while minimizing the cost of $u$ itself, $C(u)$:
$$U_{S_{1}}(u;s) = \textrm{log}(P_{L_{0}}(s|u)) - C(u).$$
$S_1$ chooses utterances in proportion to their utility:
$$P_{S_{1}} (u|s) \propto   \textrm{exp}(\alpha \cdot U_{S_{1}} (u;s)).$$
At the top layer of inference, the \emph{pragmatic} listener $L_1$ infers $s$ on the basis of some observed $u$. The result is a distribution over likely states $s$; however, unlike $L_0$, $L_1$ updates beliefs about the world by reasoning about the process that \emph{generated} $u$, namely $S_1$. In other words, $L_1$ reasons about the $s$ that would have been most likely to lead $S_1$ to choose the  $u$ that was observed:
$$P_{L_{1}}(s|u) \propto P_{S_{1}}(u|s) \cdot P(s).$$

\citeA{frankgoodman2012} test the predictions of their model against behavioral data from reference games as in Figure \ref{FG-ref-game}. To model production behavior---which utterance should be chosen to communicate a given object---the authors generate predictions from $S_1$. To model interpretation behavior---which object is the speaker trying to communicate on the basis of their utterance---the authors generate predictions from $L_1$. Finding extremely high correlations between model predictions and behavioral data in both cases, \citeauthor{frankgoodman2012} have strong support for their model of pragmatic reasoning in reference games (see also \citeNP{qingfranke2015}, for a fuller exploration of the modeling choices).

Our model builds on the vanilla version of RSA above by allowing for uncertainty around the listener's state prior, $P(s)$. \ We have in mind a scenario where a speaker chooses an utterance, observes the listener's referent choice, and, on the basis of that choice, infers the preferences the listener might have had when making it. We use the same $L_0$ and $S_1$ from the vanilla model. However, we now parameterize $L_1$ so that it operates with respect to a given state prior $\mathcal{P}$:
$$P_{L_{1}}(s|u,\mathcal{P}) \propto P_{S_{1}}(u|s) \cdot \mathcal{P}(s).$$
We then model a pragmatic speaker $S_2$ who updates beliefs about $L_1$'s prior beliefs, $P(\mathcal{P})$. To do so, $S_2$ produces $u$ and observes $L_1$'s choice of $s$, then reasons about the prior beliefs $\mathcal{P}$ that $L_1$ used to make that choice:
$$P_{S_{2}}(\mathcal{P}|u,s) \propto P_{L_{1}}(s|u,\mathcal{P}) \cdot P(\mathcal{P}).$$
