\begin{abstract}
From the Gricean tradition, ambiguity in language is something to be avoided. 
However, ambiguity seems ubiquitous during conversations. 
We propose that speakers sometimes use ambiguous utterances because they are interested in the opinions, preferences, and beliefs of their listeners. 
We model this hypothesis within the Rational Speech Act framework, adding (i) a mechanism that infers listener’s priors when analyzing their responses to (ambiguous) utterances, and (ii) the ability to choose utterances strategically for maximizing information gain. 
Using an enhanced version of the original reference game experiment (Frank \& Goodman, 2012), our model fits participants’ data, yielding extremely accurate predictions ($R^2>90\%$).
This finding shows that when monitoring a conversation partner's response to an ambiguous utterance, speakers can learn something about the partner's preferences.
Moreover, speakers can choose utterances that are expected to yield the most information about those preferences.

\section{Introduction}

Traditionally, linguists have treated ambiguity as a bug in the communication system, something to be avoided or explained away \cite{grice1975,chomsky2002minimalism}.
More recent research has begun to take notice of the efficiency ambiguity affords to us: by relying on context to fill in missing information, we can reuse lightweight bits of language rather than fully specifying the intended message \cite{levinson2000,piantadosietal2012,wasow2015}. 
Viewed in this way, ambiguity serves as a feature---not a bug---of an efficient communication system.
This reasoning accords with years of psycholinguistic research documenting that speakers readily produce ambiguous utterances (see \citeNP{ferreira2008}, for an overview). 


Along related lines, \citeA{wasow2015} reviews a large body of evidence and concludes that ambiguity is rarely avoided, even in situations where it would be communicatively appropriate.
This observation stands at odds with the Gricean maxim to avoid ambiguity (\citeNP{grice1975}).
However, even \citeauthor{grice1975} recognized a case of strategic ambiguity where it could be the intention of the speaker to communicate both possible interpretations afforded by an ambiguous utterance. In such cases, recognition of the ambiguity serves as the communicative purpose of the utterance. \citeauthor{wasow2015}, on the other hand, reviews several cases where ambiguity production serves no obvious communicative purpose.

In search of the communicative purpose of ambiguous language, the current work identifies an additional benefit in using such language: the \emph{extra} information we gain from observing how our listeners resolve ambiguity.
We propose that language users learn about each other's private knowledge by observing how they resolve ambiguity. If language does not do the job of specifying the information necessary for full interpretation, then listeners are left to draw on their opinions, beliefs, and preferences to fill in the gaps; by observing how listeners fill those gaps, speakers learn about the opinions, beliefs, and preferences of the listeners.
In a dynamic, naturalistic conversation, speakers can take turns choosing ambiguous statements in order to leave room for their parter to fill the missing information in, thereby revealing opinions, beliefs, and preferences. 


By way of illustration, take, for example, the scenario in Fig.~\ref{FG-ref-game}. Suppose a speaker produces the single-word utterance ``blue'' in an attempt to signal one of the objects to a listener. The utterance is ambiguous; the listener can choose either the blue square or the blue circle. Suppose further that, upon hearing ``blue,'' the listener selects the blue circle. In observing this choice, the speaker learns something about the private thoughts of the listener: what made her select the blue circle instead of the blue square? Perhaps the circle is more salient to the listener, or the listener has a preference for circles, or the listener may believe that the speaker has a preference for circles; there may even be a mutual agreement that circles are to be preferred when possible. Importantly, by observing how the listener resolves the ambiguity in reference, the speaker can learn something about the private thoughts of the listener.

In this scenario, the speaker chooses between the utterances ``blue,'' ``green,'' ``square,'' and ``circle.''}\label{FG-ref-game}
\end{figure}

However, accessing this added information requires the speaker to reason pragmatically about the pragmatic reasoning of the listener---a higher-order pragmatic reasoning, as it were. In order to select a referent, the listener must interpret the utterance. We follow \citeA{frankgoodman2012} in treating this interpretation process as active pragmatic, probabilistic reasoning: the listener interprets an utterance by reasoning about the process that generated it, namely the speaker, who selects an utterance by reasoning about how a listener would interpret it. \citeauthor{frankgoodman2012} model this recursive social reasoning between speakers and listeners, marking the launch of the Rational Speech Act (RSA) modeling framework (see also \citeNP{frankejaeger2016,goodmanfrank2016}).

The current paper builds on the foundational, vanilla RSA model of reference games by introducing uncertainty about the prior beliefs of the listener and modeling a speaker who reasons about these beliefs on the basis of and in anticipation of the observed referent choice. 
We begin by walking through our modeling assumptions. 
We then present our model in full detail, and test the behavioral predictions of our model against human data in a series of web-based experiments.
We conclude with a discussion of the significance of our findings for understanding ambiguity in natural language, and relate the findings to current theories of predictive coding and active inference.


\section{Model}

We begin with the vanilla RSA model of \citeA{frankgoodman2012}. The recursive social reasoning inherent to the RSA modeling framework gets cashed out as various layers of inference. At the base, there is a hypothetical, na\"ive literal listener $L_0$ who hears an utterance $u$ and infers the state of the world $s$ that utterance is meant to describe, that is, the object that may be referred to by the utterance. $L_0$ performs this inference by conditioning on the literal semantics of $u$, \sem{$u$}. $L_0$ thus returns a uniform distribution over those states $s$ that can be truthfully described by $u$:
$$P_{L_{0}}(s|u) \propto \sem{$u$}(s).$$
One layer up, the speaker $S_1$ observes some state $s$ and chooses an utterance $u$ to communicate that state to $L_0$. $S_1$ chooses utterances on the basis of their utility for signaling $s$ to $L_0$, $U_{S_1}(u;s)$. The speaker's utility maximizes the probability that $L_0$ would arrive at the correct $s$ on the basis of $u$, $P_{L_{0}}(s|u)$, while minimizing the cost of $u$ itself, $C(u)$:
$$U_{S_{1}}(u;s) = \textrm{log}(P_{L_{0}}(s|u)) - C(u).$$
$S_1$ chooses utterances in proportion to their utility:
$$P_{S_{1}} (u|s) \propto   \textrm{exp}(\alpha \cdot U_{S_{1}} (u;s)).$$
At the top layer of inference, the \emph{pragmatic} listener $L_1$ infers $s$ on the basis of some observed $u$. The result is a distribution over likely states $s$; however, unlike $L_0$, $L_1$ updates beliefs about the world by reasoning about the process that \emph{generated} $u$, namely $S_1$. In other words, $L_1$ reasons about the $s$ that would have been most likely to lead $S_1$ to choose the $u$ that was observed:
$$P_{L_{1}}(s|u) \propto P_{S_{1}}(u|s) \cdot P(s).$$

\citeA{frankgoodman2012} tested the predictions of their model against behavioral data from reference games as in Figure \ref{FG-ref-game}. To model production behavior (i.e., which utterance should be chosen to communicate a given object) the authors generate predictions from $S_1$. To model interpretation behavior (i.e., which object is the speaker trying to communicate on the basis of their utterance) the authors generate predictions from $L_1$. Finding extremely high correlations between model predictions and behavioral data in both cases, \citeauthor{frankgoodman2012} have strong support for their model of pragmatic reasoning in reference games (see also \citeNP{qingfranke2015}, for a fuller exploration of the modeling choices).

Our model builds on the vanilla version of RSA above by allowing for uncertainty around the listener's state prior, $P(s)$. We have in mind a scenario where a listener might have a preference for a certain object feature (e.g., blue things, squares, circles, etc.), and these preference will influence their object choice. With this in mind, the speaker produces an utterance $u$, observes the listener's referent choice $s$, and, on the basis of that choice, infers the preferences $f$ the listener might have had when making the choice.
We use the same $L_0$ and $S_1$ from the vanilla model. However, we now parameterize $L_1$'s state prior so that it operates with respect to a given feature preference $P(s|f)$:
$$P_{L_{1}}(s|u,f) \propto P_{S_{1}}(u|s) \cdot P(s|f).$$
We then model a pragmatic speaker $S_2$ who updates beliefs about $L_1$'s preferences, $P(f)$. To do so, $S_2$ produces $u$, then observes $L_1$'s choice of $s$, and finally reasons about the likely feature preference $f$ that $L_1$ used to make that choice:
$$P_{S_{2}}(f|u,s) \propto P_{L_{1}}(s|u,f) \cdot P(f).$$
Moreover, we model the reasoning process by which a speaker selects the best utterance to learn about the preferences of the listener.
Starting with no knowledge of the listener's preferences, $S_2$ can be assumed to expect a uniform (i.e., flat) feature preference prior $P(f)$. The more the speaker's posterior beliefs about the preferences, $P_{S_{2}}(f|u,s)$, deviate from the uniform prior, the more the speaker will have learned about the listener's preferences. 
We can thus model this reasoning in the light of expected information gain, which can be equated with the attempt to maximize the KL divergence between the speaker's prior and the expected posterior of the listener's feature preferences $f$, integrating over all hypothetically possible state observations $s$:
$$P_{b}(u) \propto \sum_{s:\  [\![u]\!](s)}\lambda \cdot \textrm{KL}(P(f),P_{S_{2}}(f|u,s))-C(u).$$

We now have two sets of predictions from our model to check: first, the pragmatic speaker's inference about the listener's feature preferences on the basis of their object choice; and second, the pragmatic speaker's strategic utterance selection in the light of the anticipated information gain about the listener's preferences considering their possible object choices. Below, we present two experiments that test these predictions against human behavior.


\section{Expt.~1: Inferring preferences}

Our first task is to check the predictions of our $S_2$ layer: having observed that a listener selects some object $s$ in response to an utterance $u$, what are the most likely preferences the listener had when making their choice? 

\subsection{Participants}

We recruited 90 participants with US IP addresses through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service. Participants were compensated for their participation. On the basis of a post-test demographics questionnaire, we identified 82 participants as native speakers of English; their data were included in the analyses reported below.

\subsection{Design and methods}

We presented participants with a series of reference game scenarios modeled after Figure \ref{FG-ref-game} from \citeA{frankgoodman2012}. Each scenario featured two people and three objects. One of the people served as the speaker, and the other served as the listener. The speaker asks the listener to choose one of the objects, but in doing so she is allowed to mention only one of the features of the target object. Participants were told that the listener might have a preference for certain object features, and participants were tasked with inferring those preferences after observing the speaker's utterance and listener's object choice.

We followed \citeA{frankgoodman2012} in our stimuli creation. Objects were allowed to vary along three dimensions: color (blue, red, green), shape (cloud, circle, or square), and pattern (solid, striped, polka-dotted). The speaker's utterance was chosen at random from the properties of the three objects present, and the listener's choice was chosen at random from the subset of the three objects that contained the uttered feature. By varying the object properties, the targeted object, and the utterance, we generated a total of 2400 scenarios. Speaker and listener names were chosen randomly in each trial. Participants saw the speaker's utterance in bold (e.g., ``green'' in Figure \ref{exp1-trial}) and the listener's choice appeared with a dotted orange outline (e.g., the leftmost object in Figure \ref{exp1-trial}). Based on the observed choice, participants were instructed to adjust a series of six sliders to indicate how likely it is that the listener had a preference for a given feature. The sliders specified the six feature values of the two feature dimension that were not mentioned in the speaker's utterance (e.g., pattern and shape in Figure \ref{exp1-trial}). Participants completed a series of $15$ trials. Objects and utterances were chosen as detailed above, with the constraint that 10 trials were potentially informative with respect to listener preferences and 5 trials were uninformative with respect to listener preferences (e.g., observing that the listener chose one of three identical objects).

\end{figure}



% I used the code length(levels(as.factor(uniqueCCode))) to calculate the number of conditions

%Since not all of the stimuli allowed for inference of preferences in the same way, we introduced a new categorization of stimuli. Our base model would then predict the same preferences for the same category of stimuli. The categorization takes into account the distribution of features, the chosen object and which feature was uttered. Each category consists of 3 tuples of 2 digits. Each tuple refers to one feature, where the first tuple always refers to the uttered feature. The first digit in each tuple would then denote how many objects share the value of the picked object for the corresponding feature. In figure \ref{FG-ref-game}, if the utterance was blue and the blue square was picked, the first tuple would reference color and its first digit would be a "2". Note that this does not determine which other object shares the feature value, i.e. "blue". To compensate, the second digit of the tuple denotes which other object shares this value. This depends on the order of the objects -- we stipulated that the picked object would be the first. The further order would be determined by which other object shares this specific value, i.e. the "blue circle" in figure \ref{FG-ref-game} would be the first of the "other objects" and the "green square" the second. The picked object is at position zero in this sense. Thus the first tuple for figure \ref{FG-ref-game} would be (2,1). For the other tuples, the first digits would be "2" for shape and "3" for texture. To streamline the category code we stipulated that we would order the features in descending order of their first digit, so that we would have texture's "3" next in figure \ref{FG-ref-game}. If a tuple starts with "3" or "1", the second digit would simply denote whether the other objects have different values for that feature or the same. Thus we would have (3,2) for texture, with the second digit signaling that the non-picked objects share their texture. The tuple for shape would finally be (2,2), because the value "square" is shared with the second other object (see above). Thus for figure \ref{FG-ref-game} we would end up with [(2,1),(3,2),(2,2)].

The $S_2$ layer of our RSA model returns a posterior distribution over inferred feature preferences $f$ after observing a listener selecting an object in response to an utterance. 
Model predictions depend on two parameters.
The first is the soft-max scaling parameter $\alpha$ in the $S_1$ layer of the model, where the default value is typically set to $\alpha=1$. 
This parameter controls how likely $S_1$ is to maximize utility when choosing utterances. The second parameter scales the strength of individual feature preferences $f_i$. 
The softness parameter $\gamma$ determines how strong a preference is if a certain feature value is indeed preferred.
This parameter controls the shape of each of the possible feature preferences $f_i$ that $S_2$ considers. 
Preference softness increases with $\gamma$: 
a value of $\gamma=0$ specifies a hard preference, that is, the listener will always choose the object that contains the preferred feature value if possible. 
We assume $\gamma=0$ as the default model value. 
On the other hand, $\gamma \rightarrow \infty$ specifies a uniform feature value preference, that is, no actual preference.
As a result, a large value of $\gamma$ approximates a uniform-prior model. %such that the RSA models can be viewed as being nested within the default model.
% Note: I removed $\beta$ because it complicates things enormously and proved to be not really relevant.
%Finally, we allow for the possibility of noise in our human data introduced by participants not following instructions. The parameter $\beta$ \gcs{description of what $\beta$ does precisely}. As $\beta$ increases, speakers disregard instructions \gcs{summary of the effect}; at zero, speakers fully obey instructions. \gcs{summary of effect}.
%the For example, if a $S_2$ observes that following an utterance $blue$ and three objects all three of which are blue, but all differ in shape, the speaker chooses a square, the speaker might conclude that the $L_1$  has a preference for squares. However, the exact value on the slider the $S_2$ picks depends on the $\gamma$ parameter: if it is close to $0$, the speaker will mark that the $L_1$ had a perefernce for squares close to $1$. As the parameter value increases, the softness of preference will increase as well, drawing the preference value towards uniform (uninformative).
%he model contains three parameters: the informativity paramter $\alpha$ (how informative speakers choose to be), the obey-instructions parameter $\beta$, and the softness of preferences parameter $\gamma$. The latter 

% \gcs{We need to say something about how we fit individual participant data. How exactly where the parameter values fit? What were candidate values?}

We optimized $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ in the light of the KL divergence between the individual participants' slider value choices and the corresponding model predictions:
$$KL = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\textrm P(f'_i|u,s) (\textrm {log} (P(f'_i|u,s) - \textrm {log} (P(f_i|u,s)),$$
where $P(f'_i|u,s)$ specifies a participant's normalized slider value settings, that is, empirical estimates of the feature preference posterior given an object scene and a particular utterance $u$ and object choice $s$; $P(f_i|u,s)$ specifies the respective model prediction value.
Since no conclusions can be drawn concerning feature values that are not present in the scene, we ignored the respective feature preference estimates. 


By minimizing KL divergence between the empirical and model-predicted preferences for each participant, we maximize the model fit to the individual participants' data.
When compared to the uniform-distribution base model, optimizing $\gamma$ alone yielded a much lower KL divergence value: while the uniform base model yields an average KL divergence of $9.848$ (median=$7.028$), our extended RSA model with individually-optimized $\gamma$ parameters yielded an average KL divergence of $2.058$ (median=$1.524$). 
When optimizing $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ together, a yet smaller average KL divergence of $1.451$ (median=$0.952$) is reached.
In the light of the $G^2$ statistics and under the assumption that we calculated $2$ KL divergences in all $15$ trials per participant, the KL values should be multiplied by $2*15*2=60$ to yield a $G^2$ estimate, although one may want to consider the two KL divergences in each trial as closely related, such that $2*15=30$ may be considered as a more passive multiplier.
With this factor, we get a difference of $233.7$ between the uniform base model and the one-parameter extended RSA model, while the addition of $\alpha$ improves $G^2$ further by a value of $18.21$. Both of these results are far above the cutoff value of $6.63$ for $p=.01$, assuming a Chi-square distribution \cite{Lewandowsky:2011}. 
Thus, the extended model exceeds the uniform base model with very high likelihood. 
However, considering the much smaller improvement due to the additional optimization of $\alpha$, we analyze correlations with respect to the one-parameter (i.e., $\gamma$-optimized) model in what follows. 

When considering the distribution of optimized parameters, we can identify three participants who cause the optimization process to yield $\gamma$ values above $100$, indicating lazy participants who simply leave the slider values unadjusted. 
Another 15 participants yielded a $\gamma$ value above $1$, which indicates that they are considering preferences only to a small extent. The rest (i.e. 64 participants) yielded values below $1$, indicating a strong consideration of preference inferences in line with the model. 
 
%We compared  in the light of the distinguishable interpretation cases. 
To compare RSA model predictions to the human data, we identified all distinguishable cases in the light of the ambiguity of the chosen utterance and the possible object choices, essentially binning the data of all stimuli for which the extended RSA model yields equal preference-estimate posteriors; there were $48$ scene types in our stimuli.
%We binned those scene types 
For all scene types, the actual feature values and objects in a scene were reordered according to the specific preference inference involved. 
Thus, after reordering, the results of the individual slider values for individual scenes in each scene type could be averaged for both the participant data and the model predictions. 


We plot predictions from the $\gamma$-optimized model in Figure \ref{exp1-results}, where a strong positive correlation between the human judgments and model predictions ($r^2 = 0.96, p < 0.001$) can be observed. Thus, we find strong empirical support for our extended RSA model of preference inference: speakers are indeed able to use listener behavior to arrive at information about their preferences. The question now turns to whether speakers are aware of the relative utility of different utterances when it comes to this reasoning. In other words, are speakers aware that ambiguous language is potentially more informative?

\section{Expt.~2: Choosing utterances}

Our next task is to check the predictions of our strategic utterance selection model: given a set of potential referents, which utterance would be most informative with respect to the listener's preferences?

\subsection{Participants}

We recruited 90 participants with US IP addresses through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service; participants in Experiment 1 were not eligible to participate in Experiment 2. Participants were compensated for their participation. On the basis of a post-test demographics questionnaire, we again identified  82 participants as native speakers of English; their data were included in the analyses reported below.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{images/exp2-trial.eps}
	\caption{A sample trial from \emph{Experiment 2: Choosing utterances}.}\label{exp2-trial}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Design and methods}

Participants encountered a reference game scenario similar to Experiment 1 in which a speaker signals an object to a listener who might have a preference for certain types of objects. However, rather than observing the utterance and referent choice, participants were now tasked with helping the speaker choose an utterance that was ``most likely to reveal the listener's color, shape, or pattern preferences.''

We used the same sets of objects from Experiment 1, which could vary along three dimensions. Each trial featured a set of three objects, as in Figure \ref{exp2-trial}. After observing the objects, participants adjusted sliders to indicate which single-feature utterance the speaker should choose. Potential utterances corresponded to the features of the objects present; depending on the number of unique features, participants adjusted between three and nine sliders, which specified the present feature values. Participants completed a series of 15 trials. As with Experiment 1, objects were chosen at random, with the constraint that 10 trials were potentially informative with respect to listener preferences (as in Figure \ref{exp2-trial}) and 5 trials were uninformative with respect to listener preferences (e.g., observing a set of three identical objects). 

\subsection{Results}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3in]{images/X3-scatter-CogSci.eps}
	\caption{Experiment 2 results; $r^{2}=0.91$, 95\% CI [0.84, 0.85].}\label{exp2-results}
\end{figure}



% I recorded the same number of conditions as in Experiment 1. I think Experiment 2 used the same ambiguity code.

By reasoning the about predictions of $S_2$, we are able to use our extended RSA model to compute the expected most informative utterance with respect to inferring preferences. In other words, $P_b(u)$ calculates the probability that a speaker would choose $u$ for the purpose of inferring preferences in our reference game scenario.
To generate predictions from $P_b(u)$, a total of three free parameters can be identified. 
As with the analysis for Experiment 1, we consider different values for $\alpha$ (i.e., speaker's soft-max factor) and $\gamma$ (i.e., preference softness). 
We must also set the $\lambda$ parameter, which factors the importance of choosing the expected most informative utterance with respect to the determined KL divergence values.
Note that when allowing negative values for $\lambda$, negated information gain essentially minimizes expected information gain.
Thus, in this case the model would favor unambiguous utterances. 
Moreover, when $\lambda=0$, the collapses to a uniform distribution of utterance choices, thus yielding a nested model to a uniform base model. 

We again optimized model values with respect to KL divergence estimates between the participant data and the model predictions---in this case for utterance preference distributions. 
The results for the uniform base model yielded an average KL divergence value of $5.415$ (median=$3.997$), while the model optimized $\lambda$ yielded a mean KL divergence of $3.774$ (median=$2.108$).
Again determining $G^2$ to enable a Chi-square test for significant model differences in fitting the data, the difference between the base model and one parameter model (factored by $2*15=30$) of $49.23$ (median difference of $56.67$) is highly significant, indicating that the one-parameter model fits the data much better than a uniform base model. 
% Note: these interesting observations may not be mentioned _ I leave them in for now because the discussion can relate to them 

As with the results of the previous experiment, we were able to distinguish three groups of participants on the basis of the fitted parameter values of $\lambda$. 
The first was a ``lazy worker'' group of $18$ participants whose fitted $\lambda$ values were close to zero (i.e.,  $-.02 < \lambda<.02$).
The second group of $32$ participants yielded more negative values (i.e., $-8.20<\lambda<-.02$), indicating that a significant number of participants preferred to systematically choose non-ambiguous utterances. 
The third group of again $32$ participants yielded more positive values (i.e., $.02<\lambda<.47$), indicating that these participants indeed chose the most ambiguous utterance in a rather strategic manner. 


The proper model fit is confirmed when considering the correlation between the participants' data and the model predictions. 
As with Experiment 1, we averaged the data and the respective model predictions across specific case bins, which include all scenes that yield identical utterance choice options. 
In this case, $14$ distinct conditions can be identified, with a total of $84$ slider values to set. 
% Note: I did check it - there are indeed 14. 5+5+6+7+6+6+7+3+4+5+6+7+8+9
After matching the respective actual feature values with the utterance choice relevant within the respectively-binned conditions, we again computed averages over utterance preference values for the respectively-binned trials across participants and across respective model predictions. 


Figure \ref{exp2-results} plots predictions from the $\lambda$-optimized model, together with the human data. Again, we observe a strong positive correlation between the human judgments and model predictions ($r^2 = 0.91, p < 0.001$). In other words, we find evidence in support of the idea that speakers reason pragmatically about the relative informativity of ambiguous language.



\section{Discussion}

We have found strong support for our model of inferring priors on the basis of ambiguous language.
The results of Experiment 1 demonstrate that na\"ive speakers are able to reason pragmatically about \emph{why} listeners may take the actions they do, and the success of our computational model in predicting the observed behavior offers an articulated hypothesis about \emph{how} this reasoning proceeds: when speakers are aware of the ambiguity in their utterances, observing how listeners resolve that ambiguity provides clues to the preferences listeners use when doing so.
The results of Experiment 2 demonstrate that speakers are able to capitalize on this reasoning to strategically select utterances that are most likely to inform their understanding of the preferences of their listeners, and that the most informative utterances are also the ambiguous ones.

Taken together, the results of our experiments and the success of our model in predicting those results indicate that humans are aware of the fact that by observing responses to ambiguous utterances, information about the listener's prior preferences can be inferred. 
Used in this way to inform preferences, ambiguous utterances are closely related to questions, which may ask directly about the  relevant preferences. 
However, ambiguous language provides a ready alternative to asking directly. In normal conversations, a speaker might favor the indirect route afforded by ambiguous utterances, given considerations of politeness and possibly also in an effort to keep the conversation on track.  

We note that the analyzed preference prior, viewed from a broader perspective, can be interpreted as the general predictive state of mind of the listener when interpreting the speaker's utterance \cite{Butz:2017}. 
Thus, this state of mind does not only include preferences per se, but all imaginable opinions, beliefs, \emph{and} preferences of the listener. 
Moreover, during a conversation, this prior will dynamically develop depending on the internal predictive models and the generated utterances and actions of the speaker and listener. This prior depends on the privileged grounds of the conversation partners, and also on the common ground in which the conversation unfolds. Ambiguous utterances are one device for making the privileged ground common knowledge. 


%Moreover, there 
%in conversation the priors dynamically unfold according to beliefs and preferences about the world and speakers
%twin anecdote, politeness (why not ask directly?)
%is ambiguity a feature that evolved under pressure from these considerations (i.e., informing preferences), or did ambiguity predate these considerations and speakers merely figured out clever ways of capitalizing on it---a lemonade-out-of-lemons scenario?
