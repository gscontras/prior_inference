7,English,2,Male,29,"The activity was different from most HITs.  That was enjoyable.  The first half was easy enough, but lack of probability displays made me unsure whether when picking between 2 of 3 equally likely outcomes if I should move 2 sliders to 66 and one to 0 or leave the 2 at 50.  When we switched rolls halfway through, switching names every time added unnecessary complexity.  Simply dubbing the roles Player A and Player B would have made it feel more consistent.  These names confused me for the first half of the second half of the task.",Confused,3
